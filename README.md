**NOTE: _our lovely bot is no longer sentient and alive, as the mantience cost was too high, but still please visit our bot on twitter to look at past interactions and our code base to see how it was built_**

**AlchemyPDXBot** is a whimsical twitter bot created by Claire Cassidy (@lasermistress), Emily Ford (@cybruja), and Alex Ramirez de Cruz (@dev_de_cruz) for the alchemy code lab community. 

* If you have a coding question just include our bot handle **@AlchemyPDXBot** and your question with **#help** and the bot will post your original question so the alchemy community can comment with answers/ideas.
* Had a long day of coding and need a pick-me-up? Tweet **@AlchemyPDXBot** with **#joke**, and our bot will tweet you a random coding joke.
* Did you meet a milestone or have a favorite memory or pic of your time at alchemy? Tweet **@AlchemyPDXBot** with **#AlchemyMoment** and it will be saved in a collection and retweeted as a throwback once a week.
* We also have a Rasberry Pi with a keypad of emojis we programmed, living within the Alchemy building, coders can take a moment in their day to create an emoji story on the keypad and our bot will post it.
